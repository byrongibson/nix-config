Btw I use obsidian for work only, in our shared work obsidian vault

- We use a canva and have multiple notes spread out on this canva with dataview showing tasks fetched by the tasks plugin
- We have a INBOX note, actions list dataview fetching tasks with different contexts (#contexts/shallow, #contexts/deep) And we have one note for each member that shows a dataview for all tasks with the tag of the user Mine for example, is #contexts/danymat (ofc something else)
- And other things such as waiting for, due dates, etc So that we can create notes from everywhere in the vault and it appears there Kinda cool tbh
- ronkdar*February 3, 2024 8:15 PM*February 3, 2024 8:15 PMThat's actually pretty nifty.

Never thought to use one Obsidian vault for a team

- Danymat*February 3, 2024 8:18 PM*February 3, 2024 8:18 PMWe store all our Pentest notes/reports/processes/knowledge there
- That quite good

I dont Collab with git is a pain in the a**

- Thats the only thing impeding mass adoption i think: a good live collaboration feature

### ronkdar*February 5, 2024 4:58 AM*February 5, 2024 4:58 AM

Honestly I would love to have a smart whiteboard that could important my hand drawn diagrams into Visio

- I am blessed with an *enormous* whiteboard in my office.
- Sevoris*February 5, 2024 7:12 AM*February 5, 2024 7:12 AMI got the semi-shite version of that - we have treated walls that you can marker onto and use magnets on.Still very nice when you need estate to whiteboard on
- Danymat*February 5, 2024 9:24 AM*February 5, 2024 9:24 AMLmao that’s so true
- Danymat*February 5, 2024 9:25 AM*February 5, 2024 9:25 AMStart with excalidraw and stay there for as long as possible
- Sevoris*February 5, 2024 10:52 AM*February 5, 2024 10:52 AMtbh much as I like it, sometimes it is frustratingly limited and I go over to [](ghttp://draw.io)
* [draw.io](http://draw.io)
- ronkdar*February 5, 2024 2:23 PM*February 5, 2024 2:23 PMWork has the full MS Office suite. Why would i use anything except Visio?
- Sevoris*February 5, 2024 2:42 PM*February 5, 2024 2:42 PMIdk, I have access as well and find Visio heavy and clunky
- Plus it doesn‘t embedd.
- Danymat*February 5, 2024 2:47 PM*February 5, 2024 2:47 PMUse what you like/what you’re good at/what you have/what other have
- For me, we don’t have Visio, xmind is not that good for us, obsidian canva too limited, and [](ghttp://draw.io)
* [draw.io](http://draw.io) is good but lacks the liberty of the excalidraw canva
- ronkdar*February 5, 2024 2:48 PM*February 5, 2024 2:48 PMFor me, SharePoint integration makes many sins forgiveable.

Wait this is Awesome

- Sevoris*February 6, 2024 3:21 PM*February 6, 2024 3:21 PMKind of. Unfortenatly the base for this is the very german ingrain wallpaper, and that means there are many knoocks and cranies for marker color to be protected from when you try and wipe it off
- judicious use of cleaning fluid is strongly advised

### ronkdar*February 8, 2024 3:53 PM*February 8, 2024 3:53 PM

For any ADD/ADHD people here, I picked up a technique from No Boilerplate (youtuber) that integrates well with GTD: DO THE HARDEST THING FIRST.

My brain regularly tries to sabotage me from doing any task that feels like a chore (high effort, low reward), so I always tend to do easy tasks first.

### Danymat*February 8, 2024 3:54 PM*February 8, 2024 3:54 PM

The famous « eat the frog

?”

### ronkdar*February 8, 2024 3:54 PM*February 8, 2024 3:54 PM

After I do a bunch of easy tasks, I'm out of motivation for the day, so I don't start any hard tasks.

Repeat every day, and the hard tasks never get done.

So, in my Obsidian GTD system, I have tags #hard and #veryhard and filters that will push tasks with those tags closer to the top of my DO THIS NEXT list

- That list is mostly sorted like:
- tasks due today
- tasks due this week
- hard tasks
- everything else
- A hard task due today instantly goes to the top of the list.
- Following this is challenging. My brain hates it. But I'm a lot more effective at work using this system.
- purewater*February 8, 2024 4:56 PM*February 8, 2024 4:56 PMThis never worked for me unfortunately
- ronkdar*February 8, 2024 5:02 PM*February 8, 2024 5:02 PMIt only barely works for me, but it's been an improvement.

Coming from an OCD guy, try to do a "pre-mortem". If you are familiar with post-mortems, it's all about finding out what happened by looking at the evidence left behind. A pre-mortem would be writing a note with the following headings:

1. What do I want to do? Write exactly what you are doing and when. Do not leave room for interpretation.
2. Why am I doing this? Explain to yourself why you are doing it. Why is it important to you?
3. How will you do it?
4. How will you know you have wandered from the original task?
5. What thoughts and feelings would I need to react to to derail this action?
- Thoughts:

I have tried before and I failed. What is the point.

- Feelings:

Tiredness. Whatever.

- ronkdar*February 8, 2024 5:07 PM*February 8, 2024 5:07 PMThis makes a lot of sense.

### adlaurentius

### *February 8, 2024 5:07 PM*February 8, 2024 5:07 PM

The most useful things are writing why you are doing it, because when you are being pulled by urges, you brain is going to find very difficult to remember why you are putting yourself in such an uncomfortable situation

### ronkdar*February 8, 2024 5:07 PM*February 8, 2024 5:07 PM

I help an OCD friend answer these questions for herself, when she's trying to work through whether what she's doing is rational or not.

### adlaurentius

### *February 8, 2024 5:08 PM*February 8, 2024 5:08 PM

And the thoughts bit, so that they don't catch you by surprise, so you are ready for them and don't buy into them

- ronkdar*February 8, 2024 5:08 PM*February 8, 2024 5:08 PMYeah that makes a lot of sense.
- For AD(H)D, capturing tasks, processing, and assigning dates and other tags is the same kind of pre-mortem.

### adlaurentius

- *February 8, 2024 5:09 PM*February 8, 2024 5:09 PMYeah, I imagine there's a lot of overlap
- ronkdar*February 8, 2024 5:09 PM*February 8, 2024 5:09 PMSetting everything up ahead of time so my brain can't sabotage me when I'm not paying attention.

### adlaurentius

- *February 8, 2024 5:09 PM*February 8, 2024 5:09 PMExcept that maybe for me it's more anxiety/dread rather than excitement or boredom that pushes me around
- ronkdar*February 8, 2024 5:09 PM*February 8, 2024 5:09 PMYeah, sure

Tell her to check out Mark Freeman in youtube

- It's like a gold mine of info
- I don't do the meditation stuff but the rest I have found very useful
- ant*February 8, 2024 5:34 PM*February 8, 2024 5:34 PMI use work cycles. I have a nested template. First level is what I need to accomplish, with some prompts to help me zone in and anticipate what could go wrong or what could be a distraction. The inner level is 35 pomodoro and a couple more prompts. I add inner cycles s needed. Each level has a couple of prompts to complete at the end of the task for reflection and planning.
- WildRage*February 8, 2024 6:00 PM*February 8, 2024 6:00 PMooh that's so smart, I normally rely on things like body doubling and trying to lower the ease of access to all of my tasks because the easier it is to start them, the more likely I am to end up doing them
- ronkdar*February 8, 2024 7:37 PM*February 8, 2024 7:37 PMBody doubling?

Yeah ease of access is key. I also found that if a task is many steps long, I won't start it.

- Vhyrro*February 8, 2024 7:44 PM*February 8, 2024 7:44 PMthis is why GTD has a concept of an actionable which you create during the processing phase
- An example is on hamberg's page. You take notes of general ideas but when you process your inbox you usually convert those abstract ideas into actionable stuff:The next action needs to be aphysical visible

So if you have a multi-step problem, be sure to break it down into smaller and most importantly actionable subtasks

If I could have learnt only one productivity rule earlier in my life, it would be that one

- 
- GTD is worth it just for that bit

I remember once someone who wrote a post about GTD stuff, and said something like: "Imagine I asked you to wash one single plate. Just one. Would you argue with me? No, you would do it, just because. Just to see where I am going with this"

- 
- It's like reverse addition. No one gets addicted to something just by deciding to ruin their lives. No, they do something "just this once". "Just once more".

### purewater*February 9, 2024 6:28 PM*February 9, 2024 6:28 PM

If only I could trick myself into doing dishes by washing a single plate

- 
- ronkdar*February 9, 2024 6:28 PM*February 9, 2024 6:28 PMSeriously.

### adlaurentius

- *February 9, 2024 9:04 PM*February 9, 2024 9:04 PMI used to do a specific strategy for dishes. I would watch something that had ads, and while the ads were on, I would run to the kitchen and wash dishes while the ads lasted. Once the program started again, I would leave it where it was until the next break. It was like a remote pomodoro thing
- If you cannot answer the question "how long is this going to go on for?" you are losing
- B4mbus*February 9, 2024 10:08 PM*February 9, 2024 10:08 PMYeah that's the frog technique, "eat the biggest frog first", but it's kinda weird it works for you, as AD(H)D people typically don't have the dopamine to start the biggest tasks first so sticking with the easiest and working your way up should be better. If you're not AD(H)D paralyzed when thinking of doing the big task it's fine. The 2 minute rule plays nicely here.
- B4mbus*February 9, 2024 10:09 PM*February 9, 2024 10:09 PMThis is less or more eisenhower matrix I guess?
- Im curious about your Obsidian workflow, I also have ADHD, do you think just plain old notes app would work? Or do some of the Obsidian's automations actually helped you a lot?
- B4mbus*February 9, 2024 10:44 PM*February 9, 2024 10:44 PM [](ghttps://hamberg.no/gtd/)
* [https://hamberg.no/gtd/](https://hamberg.no/gtd/)
- Im reading this and ngl that gtd stuff seems kinda complicated
- Or my ADHD brain just makes it seem hard
- Managing lists, contexts, calendars
- ronkdar*February 9, 2024 10:51 PM*February 9, 2024 10:51 PMI use the automations to tell me what to do next
- Because I can't be trusted to decide for myself.

The hard part is obeying my own system. I do not always succeed.

- 
- ronkdar*February 9, 2024 10:52 PM*February 9, 2024 10:52 PMYou only have to use the parts you need.
- I don't use contexts or a tasks calendar.
- I sort tasks by literal work project.
- The important bit is the capture-process-act cycle.
- Because I forget shit all the time, the capture part is the biggest deal for me.

It should be as easy and fast as possible to capture a task or idea for later processing. No pressure to process it right away. Just write it the fuck down and move on.

Keeps me from getting distracted from my current task when new tasks arrive (emails or phone calls)

@B4mbus if you ping me in a few hours I'll boot up my work laptop and share my Dashboard note. It does useful things for me.

(If you don't I'll forget lmao)

### B4mbus*February 9, 2024 10:59 PM*February 9, 2024 10:59 PM

Ill ping you in about 7 because Im off to sleep soon, haha, I wont forget because my ADHD is curious of pings and I can just mark your message as unread so Ill see the ping :p
