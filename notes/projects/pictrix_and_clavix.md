# Pictrix and Clavix Shared Notes
* https://github.com/oxalica/nil - nix language server in rust
* https://github.com/nix-community/rnix-lsp - WIP language server for Nix (in Rust)
* https://github.com/nix-community/nixd - Nix language server (in C++)
* https://github.com/nerdypepper/statix - static linter (in Rust)

good list of apps: https://github.com/lra/mackup/, starship, etc

* Use templating for unsupported apps (mustache templating? Use structured template parsing for all supported configs
* Use explicit write paths (for generated configs) and optionally explicit read paths (template / pre-existing config) with default locations provided in the pictrix config folder if destination folder does not exist - which one to give precedence?
* Back up all overwritten config files
* Color print info on operations performed, write to file, write logs
